Assignment on Feature Engineering on an ecommerce dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.

The 220_A2_report is my report on the assignment.

The 220_a2_svm.py, 220_a2_lr.py and 220_a2_dt.py are the python files based on the chosen classifiers.

The SVM_H.py, LR_H.py and DT_H.py are files with explored hyperparameters.

The ovr2.py is a One vs Rest Exploration of the model.
